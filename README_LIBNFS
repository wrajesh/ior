Building
--------
If libnfs is installed in a standard location, you can use the following commands:

./bootstrap
./configure --with-libnfs

If you have installed libnfs in a custom location or compiled it by yourself, you need to specify the include directory and the library path by setting the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables:

./bootstrap
./configure [other options] --with-libnfs CFLAGS="-I /path/to/libnfs/include" LDFLAGS="-L /path/to/libnfs/lib"

If you compiled libnfs by yourself, don't forget to add the library path to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or copy the library to the same directory as the executable.

Running
-------

./ior -a LIBNFS [ior_options] [libnfs_options]
./mdtest -a LIBNFS [ior_options] [libnfs_options]
